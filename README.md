# Project Title
Current Dealership

## Description of the Project
The Dealership project is an advanced vehicle management application that lets the user manage vehicle listings, sales, and leases. 
Listings of available vehicles can be viewed; filtering of those can be done on price, make, model, year, color, and mileage.
Users will add new vehicles to the inventory and remove existing ones. It supports the sales and lease options, including finance options;
